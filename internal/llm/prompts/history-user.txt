Inputs:
- today: %q (utc date of the request)
- history_text: |
    ---BEGIN_HISTORY---
    %s
    ---END_HISTORY---

Guidance:
- Parse all entries within the last 30 days from today.
- History sources may be YAML, bulleted text, pasted app logs, or mixed prose.
- Expand acronyms and normalize exercise names to canonical slugs per the system instructions.
- Apply defaulting rules:
    - If only one reps value is provided, treat it as both target and actual.
    - If only one load is provided, treat it as both target and actual.
- Convert kilograms to pounds for numeric loads (load_lbs), rounding as appropriate.
- Consolidate duplicates across sessions to determine each exerciseâ€™s recent_best.
- Equipment:
    - Use only canonical keys in exercise.equipment; if needed, include "eq_other" and list the free-text items in exercise.equipment_other.
    - Always include both exercise.equipment_other and exercise.equipment_notes; set them to null when unused.
- Return only the History v1 JSON that validates against the provided schema.

Now produce ONLY the JSON object that conforms to the schema.
