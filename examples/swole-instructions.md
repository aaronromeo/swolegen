# 🏋️‍♂️ Strength Training Instruction Set (Personal Use)

## 🧭 Weekly Plan

- **Workout A & B**: 2× per week (60 min each)
- **Workout C**: 1× per week (30 min)
- **Running**: 2–3× per week (~20 km, outdoors)

---

## 🎯 Primary Goals

- **Muscle hypertrophy**, especially in:
  - Shoulders, arms, quads, glutes
- Improved **core and joint strength**
- Functional fitness to support 10km running
- Currently running on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday about 7 km each day
- Leaner physique and increased muscle tone
- Consistency within strict time constraints

---

## ⏱️ Scheduling & Warm-Up Rules

### Workout A & B (60 min sessions)

- Must finish in 60 minutes
- Warm-up is included in time budget
- Use equipment efficiently to avoid bottlenecks

### Workout C (30 min session)

- Can be done **early at the gym** or **later at home**
- If early:
  - Starts when gym opens
  - No running beforehand
  - Exercises must accommodate minimal warm-up
- Warm-up must be built into the 30 min window

---

## 🧰 Available Equipment

### 🏋️‍♂️ Gym Equipment

- Multiple **benches**
- Multiple **cable machines**
- **Barbells** (for deadlifts, hip thrusts, etc.)
- Full range of **dumbbells**
- **Sleds**
- Resistance machines (assumed available for isolated or supplemental work)

### 🏠 At-Home Equipment (For Workout C)

- Pull-up bar
- Kettlebells:
  - 2×15 lb, 1×20 lb, 1×25 lb
  - 2×35 lb, 2×45 lb, 1×60 lb
- Adjustable dumbbells
- Resistance bands

At-home workouts should:

- Favor **single-kettlebell/dumbbell** movements and minimal setup
- Use pull-ups and banded rows/presses to substitute for gym machines
- Fit the 30-minute cap including warm-up and minimal rest between supersets

---

## 🧱 Workout Construction

### Superset Format

All workouts use **supersets** for time efficiency. Prioritize:

1. **Big compound lifts** (e.g., squats, deadlifts, rows)
2. **Hypertrophy-focused compound movements**
3. **Core/stability/knee-focused work**
4. **Isolation or finishers** (if time allows)

Each superset gets:

- 2–4 sets depending on time
- ~60 seconds rest between supersets

---

## 🛠️ Movement Constraints & Preferences

### ✅ Encouraged

- Barbells: for deadlifts, hip thrusts, landmine work
- Dumbbells: use 1–2 sets for supersets, avoid multi-station setups
- Cables: single-station use only
- Sleds, benches, kettlebells
- Pull-up bar and resistance bands (esp. at home)

### ⚠️ Shoulder & Joint Considerations

- **Avoid barbell overhead pressing** — previous dislocation makes it risky due to instability and strain
  - Dumbbell/Arnold press is fine
- Include **shoulder hypertrophy** work for aesthetics
  - Prioritize lateral raises, rear delt flyes, and upward presses that don’t aggravate joints

### ❌ Avoid

- Barbell back squats (core strain & injury risk)
- Multi-cable setups that monopolize gym space
- Lower back–intense movements early in the day if not warmed up

---

## 🔄 Time-Constrained Adjustments

### For All Workouts

- Drop supersets to 2 sets each if needed
- Maintain exercise prioritization

### For 60-Min Workouts (A/B)

- If time is tight:
  - Drop 4-set blocks to 3 sets
  - Cap secondary superset to 2 sets
  - Skip accessory superset if needed

### For 30-Min Workout (C)

- Use **single-station pairings** (e.g., DB + bench, or one kettlebell + mat)
- Drop final superset or sub in a quick finisher
- Use smooth transitions between movements to minimize downtime

---

## 📋 Execution Principles

- **Supersets are non-negotiable** for efficiency
- Prioritize:
  - Form
  - Control
  - Muscle engagement over raw load
- Track time during workouts
- Scale reps/sets in real time to stay within the time limit
- Favor movements that align with warm-up status (e.g., mobility/stability first if early in the day)
